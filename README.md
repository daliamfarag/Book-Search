This application is designed to allow users to save book searches to the back end using Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. 
The application was built using the MERN stack, with a REACT front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.
